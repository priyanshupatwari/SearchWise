# Step 1. Define Scope & MVP

The project will be built in three phases:

1. **MVP (Core Search)** – Implement a simple semantic search that lets users find products using natural language.
2. **Recommendation System** – Add a basic recommender that suggests related or popular items.
3. **Stretch Goal** – Add a chatbot that answers product queries like “Show laptops under ₹40,000 with SSD.”

# Step 2. Data Collection & Preparation

**Datasets:**

* Amazon or Flipkart product datasets (Kaggle)
* Or scrape product details (name, description, price, category, rating)

**Cleaning Steps:**

* Convert text to lowercase
* Remove symbols and noise
* Standardize category names

---

# Step 3. Semantic Search (MVP)

**Embeddings:** Use a small, fast model like `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` from HuggingFace.
**Vector DB:** Use **ChromaDB** (lightweight and local).

**Pipeline:**

1. Encode product titles + descriptions → store in ChromaDB.
2. Encode user query → retrieve top-k similar items.
3. Filter by price, rating, or category if needed.

**Stack:** Python + FastAPI backend, SQLite for metadata.

# Step 4. Recommendation System

Start with **content-based recommendations** using embeddings.
Later, add **collaborative filtering** (based on user clicks or ratings).

If user data is missing, simulate basic interactions.

---

# Step 5. Integration

**Frontend:** Simple React or plain HTML/JS search page.
**Backend:** FastAPI with endpoints for search and recommendations.
**Storage:** SQLite + ChromaDB (local or hosted).
**Deployment:** Host backend on Render, Railway, or Azure App Service.

---

# Step 6. (Optional) Chatbot

Add a small LLM or API like GPT-3.5 for handling natural language queries.
Use **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to fetch relevant products and generate responses.

---

# Step 7. Evaluation

* **Search:** Precision@k, Recall@k
* **Recommendations:** Hit Rate
* **Chatbot:** Manual user testing for relevance

# Step 8. Timeline (4–6 Weeks)

| Week | Task                           |
| ---- | ------------------------------ |
| 1    | Collect and clean product data |
| 2    | Build semantic search (MVP)    |
| 3–4  | Add recommendation system      |
| 5    | Integrate frontend + backend   |
| 6    | Optional: Chatbot + deployment |

---

# Tech Stack

**Backend:** Python (FastAPI)
**Frontend:** React or HTML/JS
**Vector DB:** ChromaDB
